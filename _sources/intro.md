# AMISR User Manual

<span style="color:red; font-size:30">Hi CEDAR 2024!!  This is a GLARING ERROR!!!</span>.

This is a short guide for scientific end users of AMISR data.  It will give a broad overview of how to access, plot, and interpret the data.  This guide will attempt to focus on the most important points for most basic scientific analysis rather than a detailed descriptions of all nuances in these datasets.
