# AMISR User Manual

This is a short guide for scientific end users of AMISR data.  It will give a broad overview of how to access, plot, and interpret the data.  This guide will attempt to focus on the most important points for most basic scientific analysis rather than a detailed descriptions of all nuances in these datasets.

## How to Use this Guide
This guide is a mix of background information and code examples demonstrating how to do common plotting and analysis tasks.  Although it can be read through in full, you may find it more useful to use the table of contents in the left sidebar to skip to the section most relevant to what you are trying to do.  Cross reference links have been embedded in the content to make it possible to jump easily to more information about particular topics.

Users should adopt a "copy-paste-modify" philosophy with the examples shown in this guide.  For the most part, these examples are intentionally designed to be extremely simple to illustrate the basic steps required to access and plot AMISR data.  Users are encouraged to copy/paste any examples they find helpful into their own code, but will likely have to customize it using normal python and plotting functions to suit their needs.
